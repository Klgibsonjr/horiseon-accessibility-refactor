<h2 align="center">Accessibility Code Refactor</h2>

#### Description
The purpose of this project was to increase the accessiblity of Horiseon's webpage. 

This was achieved by executing the following changes:

> * A clear title for the website was present
> * Use semantic HTML elements
> * Logically structure the HTML code before adding CSS
> * Add alt attributes to all the image with concise descriptions
> * Consolidate the CSS file to reduce clear and increase clarity

Below is an image of end result of the code refactor. Although the code has gone through a pretty extensive code refactor. The website looks and functions the same.

Here is a link to Horiseon's website featuring new coding improving the accessibility of the website. Which will not only increase the accessibility for those who need. But will also increase the SEO (search engine optimization of the site), helping it reach a broader user base.
